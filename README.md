# Customer Shopping Behavior Analysis

A brief end-to-end data analysis project focused on understanding customer purchasing patterns using **Python, SQL, and Power BI**.

## Overview
This project analyzes customer shopping data to identify key trends in demographics, product performance, spending behavior, and seasonality. The goal is to convert raw transactional data into clear business insights and strategic recommendations.

## Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) – data cleaning & EDA  
- SQL – customer segmentation and trend analysis  
- Power BI – interactive dashboard and KPI visualization  

## Key Insights
- Total Revenue: **$233K** from **3,900** transactions  
- Average Order Value: **$59.76**  
- Top Product Category: **Clothing**  
- Most Popular Season: **Spring** (demand remains consistent year-round)  
- 57% of purchases occurred **without discounts**  
- Customers segmented into **High, Medium, and Low spenders** using SQL  

## Deliverables
- Jupyter Notebook for EDA and preprocessing  
- SQL scripts for segmentation and advanced queries  
- Power BI dashboard with KPIs and visual insights  

## Outcome
The analysis highlights strong non-discounted sales, stable year-round demand, and the importance of targeting high-value customer segments rather than broad demographics.
